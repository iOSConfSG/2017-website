								<h2>Compiler Sanitizers for Fun and Profit</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">Writing code is often a two-step process: think, then write. But there are so many tools available to us for the important third step of analyzing our code: the static analyzer, and the various sanitizers included in Xcode and clang. <br/> <br/> In this session, we’ll dive into the address sanitizer and thread sanitizer: what do they do, how do they work, why would you want to include them in your workflow, and how can they improve your codebase and make you a better coder.</p>
