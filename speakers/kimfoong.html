								<h2>Power-Up Your App With Apple’s Machine Learning Frameworks</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">Even with the presence of predictive capabilities in iOS software keyboard, one of the primary inconveniences of any data-driven application is the need for data-entry via the keyboard. Although app developers have devised many ways of removing the need for keyboard data entry through the use of barcode scanning, GPS location detection, etc., the nature of a specific use case may still render an app too cumbersome for use. Developing an app with a conversational user interface with an appropriate use case not only improves usability of your app, it also makes your app accessible to users who are visually handicapped.<br/><br/>In this talk Kim Foong will demonstrate how we can use Apple’s libraries to roll-our-own conversation user interface app.</p>
