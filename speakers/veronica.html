							<p style="font-size: 85%;">For video at LinkedIn Veronica's and her team members have to ask for camera, photo library and microphone permissions in the Video recording flow. She will cover how they abstracted this code into a shared helper and  ensured it was well tested. They ran into interesting challenges with testing all the possible cases of users interacting with the permissions dialogues. <br/> <br/> This talk will cover how they solved these challenges and what approach they took.</p>
