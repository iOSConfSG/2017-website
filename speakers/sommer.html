								<h2>One navigator to rule them all</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">App navigation is hard. If each View Controller manages its own navigation, your app can end up in a very confusing state. However, if you delegate all the way up to a main view controller, then you can end up with massively long delegation chains that a nightmare to maintain. <br/> <br/> This talk looks at a different approach that Sommer and her team took at Chorus. They look at the pros and cons of this centralized app-navigator appraoch as well as the details of how it's implemented.</p>
